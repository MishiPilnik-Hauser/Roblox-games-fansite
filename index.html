Roblox High School 2 is a sequel of Roblox High School by Cindering (real name is Brian Wilson), Roblox High School 2 can also be called RHS 2 for short. Update: RHS 2 is currently getting an update called the graduation update that is a complete overhaul of RHS 2, it will hopefully be done in September or before. There is a gamepass that is called the superstar pass that gives you extra credits, give you access to the superstar club, exclusive superstar tile and chat tag, etc. (Please view the gamepasses for more information), The most expensive gamepass is the enforcers powers pass which lets you be the principal and gives you exclusive powers. With these powers, you can make announcements, host after school events, change the schedule, and start a fire drill. Note: There can only be one principal per server. For more information, please visit the RHS 2 fandom page.
